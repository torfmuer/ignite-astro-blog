If you're searching for hood cleaning prices in Spokane or North Idaho, you've probably noticed something frustrating: **nobody publishes their actual pricing.**

Every hood cleaning company says the same thing: "Call for a quote."

Why? Because they don't want you comparing prices. They don't want you knowing what you'll actually pay until they're standing in your kitchen.

I'm going to do something different. I'm going to show you **exactly what hood cleaning costs** in our market—including our complete pricing formula, real customer examples, and every possible fee.

No surprises. No hidden charges. Just the truth.

* * *

**Location:** N Division Street, Spokane  
**Setup:** 3 separate hood systems, 18 total linear feet, 9 filters  
**Add-ons needed:** 2 hinge kits, 2 grease traps (to bring up to NFPA code)

**Price Breakdown:**

*   Base rate (3 hoods): $350 × 3 = $1,050
    
*   Hood length: $37 × 18 = $666
    
*   Filters: $12 × 9 = $108
    
*   Hinge kits: $106 × 2 = $212
    
*   Grease traps: $80 × 2 = $160
    

**Total: $2,196**

**Quarterly Total: $1,824** 

* * *

### **Example 2: Taco Shop, Coeur d'Alene**

**Location:** W Prairie Avenue, Coeur d'Alene  
**Setup:** 15-foot hood, 10 filters, standard maintenance cleaning

**Price Breakdown:**

*   Base rate: $350
    
*   Hood length: $37 × 15 = $555
    
*   Filters: $12 × 10 = $120
    

**Quarterly Total: $1,025**

* * *

### **Example 3: Typical 10-Foot Hood (Most Common)**

**Setup:** Standard restaurant with 10-foot hood, 6 filters

**Price Breakdown:**

*   Base rate: $350
    
*   Hood footage: $37 × 10 = $370
    
*   Filters: $12 × 6 = $72
    

**Total: $792**

This is what most Spokane and North Idaho restaurants pay for standard quarterly cleaning.

## **What Other Hood Cleaners Won't Tell You**

Here's the uncomfortable truth about hood cleaning pricing in our market:

### **1\. "Flat Rate" Doesn't Mean "All-Inclusive"**

Most competitors quote a flat rate like "$495" or "$650," then add fees after they arrive:

*   "Staff Delay Fee" (+$150)
    
*   "Access Issues”  (+$200)
    
*   "This is dirtier than we thought, there's a dirty fee" (+$100)
    

Suddenly, your "$495 cleaning" costs $945.

We quote the actual price upfront. What we quote is what you pay.

### **2\. Cheap Prices = Skipped Work**

If someone quotes significantly under $700 for a standard hood, they're skipping critical work:

*   Not cleaning behind filter troughs
    
*   Not polishing to bare metal (NFPA 96 requirement)
    
*   Not cleaning ductwork or fan blades
    
*   Not documenting code violations
    

They spray, wipe, slap a sticker on, and leave. You think you're compliant. You're not.

### **3\. No Insurance = Your Problem**

Ask your hood cleaner: "Can I see your certificate of insurance?"

If they hesitate, you're taking on massive liability. When they damage your roof, ceiling, or equipment, you'll eventually be paying for it

### **4\. Are they actually certified?**

## **4\. Are They Actually Certified? (NFPA 96 & IKECA)**

**The Truth:** Most hood cleaners have zero certifications.

### **NFPA 96**

The fire code governing hood systems. Legitimate cleaners should:

*   Know cleaning frequencies
    
*   Clean to "bare metal" standard
    
*   Document violations
    
*   Provide Certificate of Performance
    

### **IKECA Certification**

The **International Kitchen Exhaust Cleaning Association** - the only nationally recognized hood cleaning certification.

### **Ask Your Hood Cleaner:**

"Are you IKECA certified and do you follow NFPA 96?"

If they say, "What's that?"—walk away.

* * *

## **What You're Actually Paying For**

When you hire IGNITE, here's what you get that other companies don't provide:

✅**Before and After Photos**\- We photograph everything before, during, and after  
✅ **NFPA 96 violation documentation** - We categorize violations as CLEANING / STRUCTURAL / SYSTEM  
✅ **3-year compliance records** - Full documentation for fire marshal inspections  
✅ **Off-site filter cleaning** - No caustic chemicals in your sewer (Clean Water Act compliance)  
✅ **Automated service reminders** - We track your NFPA 96 frequency requirements  
✅ **72-hour satisfaction guarantee** - Not happy? We come back and make it right  
✅ **Zero travel fees** - Spokane to Sandpoint, we don't charge extra

Most hood cleaners provide: a sticker and a bill.

* * *

## **Annual Cost: What to Budget on Average**

**NFPA 96 Frequency Requirements:**

*   **Monthly cleaning:** Solid fuel (wood, charcoal) = 12 × $792 = **$9,504/year**
    
*   **Quarterly cleaning:** High-volume operations = 4 × $792 = **$3,168/year**
    
*   **Semi-annual cleaning:** Moderate volume = 2 × $792 = **$1,584/year**
    

_(Based on typical 10-foot hood with 6 filters)_

Most restaurants need quarterly cleaning. Budget roughly $3,200 annually for compliance.

* * *

## **Red Flags: When to Walk Away**

**Don't hire a hood cleaner if they:**

*   Won't provide upfront pricing
    
*   Quote above $1,500 for a single standard hood
    
*   Can't show proof of insurance
    
*   Add "surprise fees" after arriving
    
*   Don't document NFPA 96 violations
    
*   Offer suspiciously low prices (under $500 for any hood)
    

* * *

## **Calculate Your Exact Price Right Now**

[**Your Price Formula:**](https://ignitellc.fieldd.co/)

**$350 + ($37 × hood length in feet) + ($12 × number of filters) = Your Total**

**Example:**

*   12-foot hood with 8 filters
    
*   $350 + ($37 × 12) + ($12 × 8)
    
*   $350 + $444 + $96
    
*   **\= $890**
    

Need hinge kits or grease traps? Add $106 and $80 per unit.

## **The Bottom Line**

Hood cleaning in Spokane and North Idaho should cost between **$620 and $1,200** for most restaurants, depending on hood size and condition.

If someone quotes significantly less, they're cutting corners.  
If someone quotes significantly more without clear justification, you're overpaying.  
If someone won't quote at all until they show up, they're planning to pressure you.
