## Why grills attract pests

When grilling season winds down in Coeur d’Alene, most BBQs sit idle for months. To mice, spiders, and wasps, that quiet stainless box is better than a cabin rental. Here’s why:

*   Warm, enclosed fireboxes that stay insulated during cold nights.
    
*   Grease trays and drip pans full of calories for hungry critters.
    
*   Dark spaces that rarely get disturbed between cookouts.
    

If a grill smells like food and offers shelter, rodents will gladly chew through gaskets, wiring, and insulation to get inside.

## Prevention steps from the Ignite field crew

Run through this list at the end of every season (and again before the first spring cook) to keep pests off the guest list.

Step 1

### Deep clean before storage

Break the grill down and scrub burners, trays, and cabinets. Any grease you leave behind becomes a midnight snack.

Step 2

### Cover every opening

Invest in a tight, well-fitted cover and plug gaps with stainless mesh or coarse steel wool.

Step 3

### Choose smarter storage

Rolling the BBQ into a garage or away from tall grass removes the critter highway to your cook surface.

Step 4

### Add scent deterrents

Peppermint oil, cedar blocks, and dryer sheets help, but only when paired with a spotless grill.

Step 5

### Schedule quick inspections

Pop the hood every few weeks during the off-season. Early detection is faster—and way less gross.

## Already seeing signs of a mouse hotel?

Skip the instinct to “burn them out.” High heat alone can aerosolize harmful bacteria and leave nesting material in unreachable zones. The safest move is a full teardown, degrease, and sanitation pass.

Ignite’s mobile crew handles heavy degreasing, rodent waste removal, and reassembly without leaving a mess on your patio.
